\section{Future Improvements}

Notes:

The cumulant method is a hard decision classifier.  It would be pretty easy to
determine the variance of the distribution based on SNR and create a soft
decision classifier that would output the percentage chance of each modulation.

In he gnuRadio version of the cumulant it's pretty cool to notice that although
the cumulant method is phase invarient, it is not frequency invarient.  So you
have to sample at exactly the right frequency, if you don't and thigns start to
rotate, FM, BPSK, QAM all look like PSK(inf)!
