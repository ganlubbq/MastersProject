Throughout the last few years the field of software defined radio has been
expanding and a wide variety of affordable hardware has
become readily available.  This has lead to the development and adoption of
multiple software defined radio frameworks, standards, and an open source
community creating tools and software processing blocks.  

The goal of this project is to expand on previous work classifying unknown
modulation schemes and to implement these techniques in a software defined radio
framework for use with a low cost front end receiver.  Two methods are
implemented and tested including modulation detection in the time domain through
the method of cumulants and in the frequency domain using
cyclostationary detection.

Each method's detection rates are compared through a range of SNRs using
simulation data.  Each method is tested to see how many data points are needed
for an accurate classification. Each method is then implemented in GnuRadio
and used together with the RTL-SDR hardware front end.
