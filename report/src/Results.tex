\chapter{Simulation Results}

Both methods were tested in Octave at -3dB, 0dB, 3dB, 5dB, and 10dB SNR.  As
test data, AM, Single Side Band AM, FM, BPSK, QAM, 16QAM, and 64QAM data was
used.  Each signal was modulated at 2048 Hz and sampled at 8192 Hz with complex
sampling being used.  This resulted in an over sampling rate of four.  For each
of the digital modulation schemes, a symbol rate equal to the center frequency
of 2048 Hz was used.

\section{Cumulant Method}

The cumulant algorithm works in the time domain and assumes that the signal of
interest has been shifted to baseband.  Prior to running each of the data sets
through the cumulant algorithm, the signal was first frequency shifted to
baseband and then down sampled by a factor of four.  

While \cite{swami2000} does not cover FM Modulation, an FM signal in the IQ
domain can be seen has a rotating phasor which given that the Cumulant Method is
phase invarient should result in the classification of M-PSK signal with M
approaching inifinity.
