 - Low cost SDR
 	- Discuss other options
 	- USRP (Too expensive)
 	- (Google some of the other options)
 	- Settle on the RTL-SDR, discuss properties
 	- Discuss existing GNU-Radio blocks
 
 - Practical application
	- Long term goal to make a distributed network of cheap SDRs
	- Network of signal detction and classification SDRs.
	- Use within gnuRadio
	- Use within REDHAWK SDR
   
 - Methods which work in high SNR
 	- Discuss previous work for signal detection here (From pattern recog paper)
 	- Introduce Cyclostationarity and cite the related papers with resuls for high
 	SNR
 
 - Introduction to Cyclostationary Detection
 	- Introduce basic concept
 	- Show the calculations to obtain the SCD
 	- Introduce the spectral coherence.
 	- Introduce the parameter Ia as a classification measure
 
 - Simulated Experimental results
 	- Discuss how results vary based on sample rate.
 	- Show results for different sample rates
 	- Show results vary for real and complex samples
 	- Show results for known bandwidths and noise figures
 	
 - Implementation in GnuRadio
 	- Poor SNR
 	- Very poor DC bias
 	-  Each detector as a block
 	- 

 - Implementation in REDHAWK
