\chapter{Introduction to Cyclostationary}

Much work has been done on the benefits of using Cyclostationary detection as a
means of energy detection and as a signal classification
technique; particularly in the presence of low SNR \cite{kim2007}.  For an
introduction to Cyclostationary detection \cite{costa1996} contains a lengthy introduction and
examples calculating the theoretical Spectral Correlation Density Function for
an amplitude modulated carrier.

The bulk of the work from this section is a summerization of the work found in
\cite{kim2007}.  A process $x(t)$ is said to be clyclostationary in wide sense
if its mean and autocorrelation are periodic with a period $T_0$.  This may also be expressed as; $M_x(t+T_0) = M_x(t)$ and $R_x(t+T_0, u + T_0) = R_x(t,u)$ \cite{kim2007}. 
We can represent the cyclic autocorrelation function in terms of $t$ and
$\tau$; $R_x(t+\tau/2, t-\tau/2)$ and then, due to its repetitive nature,
rewrite it as a sum of its periodic components in a Fourier Series as shown in
Equation \ref{eq:autoFourier}.

\begin{equation}
R_x(t+\tau/2, t- \tau/2) = \sum_{\alpha} R_x^{\alpha}(\tau)e^{j2\pi \alpha t}
\label{eq:autoFourier}
\end{equation}

Where $\alpha = m/T_0$ and $m$ is an integer. 

The spectral correlation function (SCF) is defined as the Fourier transform of
this cyclic autocorrelation from Equation \ref{eq:autoFourier}.

\begin{equation}
S_x^{\alpha}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_x^{\alpha}(\tau)e^{-j2\pi f \tau} d\tau
\label{eq:ScdDefined}
\end{equation}

The SCF is similar to the power spectral density of the signal which is defined
as: 

\begin{equation}
S_x(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_x(\tau)e^{-2\pi j f \tau} d\tau = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T}E[|X_T(f)|^2]
\label{eq:PSDDef}
\end{equation}


Do to this relationship, we may also define the SCF in terms of the Fourier
transform of our input signal over the interval $[0, T]$.

\begin{equation}
S_{x_T}^{\alpha}(t,f) \triangleq \frac{1}{T} X_T(t,f + \alpha / 2)X_T^*(t,f - \alpha / 2)
\label{eq:ScdDefined2}
\end{equation}

In practice, there is a trade off here.  We may either increase our time
interval $T$ which is refered to as time smoothing, or smooth over the frequency
domain by using a smaller Fourier transform size.

\begin{comment}
Next talk about how the SCD is a 3 dimentional plot and can be used to
determine the modulation but is not a comutationally efficient metric.

Go into the Spectral coherence as a better metric.
