\chapter{Introduction to Cyclostationary}

Much work has been done on the benefits of using Cyclostationary detection as a
means of energy detection and as a signal classification
technique; particularly in the presence of low SNR.  


\cite{costa96} and \cite{kim2007} do a good job of preesnting the concepts of
Cyclostationary for anyone unfarmiliar with the technique.
